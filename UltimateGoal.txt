I started this project to support the ambitions of my friend. She's not a developer and I do not wish to take this project away from her.
The ultimate goal of is to convert this project into such tech that a non-developer can easily create pages, add content, images, etc.

For Example: Let's use HTML and .md (markdown files). We can create the body in HTML such that it takes the .md inside folders and show the content.
This way any non-developer can create a markdown file and will be able to add or modify the content.

I currently have no experience in how to acheive this goal. Though I do have few ideas to try. The project is currently in React because
I'm most familiar with it and we can push updates easily and quickly meanwhile working on the ultimate goal. While doing through the directories,
you will see, I have heavily used the functional block(work in progress) technique( basically creating lego blocks for everything) so that a non-developer can
contribute with a simple documentation without going into the technecalities of the language.

With this, we also need to create the aforementioned documentation as of now.
